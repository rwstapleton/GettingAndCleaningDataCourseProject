## Data Set Description     

**Abstract:** Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.  

**Data Set Characteristics:** Multivariate, Time-Series  

**Number of Instances:** 10299  

**Number of Attributes:** 561  
    
## Study Design:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (`WALKING`, `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`, `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`, `SITTING`, `STANDING`, `LAYING`) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 
    
    
## Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:   

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## The dataset includes the following files:

- **'README.txt'**

- **'features_info.txt':** Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- **'features.txt':** List of all features.

- **'activity_labels.txt':** Links the class labels with their activity name.

- **'train/X_train.txt':** Training set.

- **'train/y_train.txt':** Training labels.

- **'test/X_test.txt':** Test set.

- **'test/y_test.txt':** Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- **'train/subject_train.txt'**: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- **'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt':** The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the **'total_acc_x_train.txt'** and **'total_acc_z_train.txt'** files for the Y and Z axis. 

- **'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt':** The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- **'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt':** The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

## Feature Selection    
   
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.     
     
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).      
     
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).      
     
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.     

tBodyAcc-XYZ    
tGravityAcc-XYZ    
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ    
tBodyGyro-XYZ     
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ    
tBodyAccMag     
tGravityAccMag    
tBodyAccJerkMag    
tBodyGyroMag     
tBodyGyroJerkMag     
fBodyAcc-XYZ     
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ    
fBodyGyro-XYZ     
fBodyAccMag    
fBodyAccJerkMag    
fBodyGyroMag    
fBodyGyroJerkMag     
    
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:     

**mean():** Mean value    
**std():** Standard deviation    
**mad():** Median absolute deviation      
**max():** Largest value in array    
**min():** Smallest value in array    
**sma():** Signal magnitude area    
**energy():** Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.     
**iqr():** Interquartile range     
**entropy():** Signal entropy    
**arCoeff():** Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4    
**correlation()**: correlation coefficient between two signals    
**maxInds():** index of the frequency component with largest magnitude    
**meanFreq():** Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency    
**skewness():** skewness of the frequency domain signal     
**kurtosis():** kurtosis of the frequency domain signal     
**bandsEnergy():** Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.    
**angle():** Angle between to vectors.    
    
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:    

gravityMean    
tBodyAccMean    
tBodyAccJerkMean    
tBodyGyroMean     
tBodyGyroJerkMean     
    
## Notes:    

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
